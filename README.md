# Wine Clustering Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on clustering wines based on their chemical properties using **K-Means Clustering**. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed features about various wine samples. The project includes data preprocessing, cluster determination, visualization, and evaluation of clustering quality.

### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Wine Dataset for Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrywang/wine-dataset-for-clustering).

### Goals
1. Understand the dataset structure and handle missing or inconsistent data
2. Standardize features
3. Use the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters
4. Perform clustering using **K-Means** and assign labels to the data
5. Visualize clusters in 2D using **PCA** and **t-SNE**
6. Evaluate the quality of clustering using the **Silhouette Score**

The project is implemented using **Google Colab**
